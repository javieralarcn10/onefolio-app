# Onefolio: Geopolitical Intelligence for Your Wealth

## 1. The Problem: The "Blind Spot" of Modern Investing

Most retail investors are flying blind. They open their brokerage apps and see green or red numbers, tickers, and charts. They know *how much* money they have, but they don't know *where* it really is.

In a globalized yet fragmented world, holding an S&P 500 ETF doesn't just mean "investing in America"—it means exposure to the US Dollar, the Tech sector, and specific geopolitical risks. Buying Bitcoin isn't just "digital gold"—it's a bet against fiat currency debasement.

**The core problem is that traditional portfolio trackers focus on *Price*, not *Risk*.**

They answer: *"Did my portfolio go up today?"*
But they fail to answer the critical questions of our time:
*   *"What happens to my wealth if the Euro crashes?"*
*   *"How exposed am I really to the Chinese manufacturing sector?"*
*   *"Is my 'diversified' portfolio actually just 90% US Tech stocks in disguise?"*

Investors have access to institutional-grade trading tools (Robinhood, IBKR), but they lack institutional-grade **risk intelligence**.

## 2. The Solution: Onefolio

Onefolio is the first personal finance app designed to visualize **Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Exposure**. It acts as an X-Ray for your wealth, deconstructing your portfolio into its atomic elements.

### Key Capabilities:
*   **True Asset Deconstruction:** We don't just track tickers. Onefolio maps every asset—from Apple stock to a physical gold bar—to its underlying **Country of Economic Risk**, **Base Currency**, and **Industrial Sector**.
*   **Unified Wealth View:** It aggregates disparate asset classes (Stocks, ETFs, Crypto, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities) into a single, cohesive dashboard.
*   **Algorithmic Health Scoring:** Using a normalized **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)**, Onefolio assigns a concrete "Diversification Score" to your portfolio, instantly highlighting concentration risks in specific regions or currencies.
*   **Privacy-First Architecture:** Financial data is processed locally on the device, ensuring user privacy and trust.

## 3. Target Audience

Onefolio targets the "Macro-Aware" investor—a growing segment of the retail market that is educated, anxious about global stability, and underserved by basic budgeting apps.

*   **The "VisualPolitik" Audience:** Viewers of geopolitical channels who understand that wars, elections, and trade tariffs directly impact their financial future.
*   **The Modern Diversifier:** Millennials and Gen Z investors who hold a complex mix of Crypto, Stocks, and perhaps a startup equity stake, and struggle to see the "big picture" across different platforms.
*   **The "Prepper" Investor:** Individuals focused on wealth preservation who use Gold, Bitcoin, and foreign currencies to hedge against systemic risk.

Onefolio utilizes a proven **Freemium Subscription Model**, implemented via RevenueCat, to align user value with business sustainability.

### Free Tier ("The Observer")
*   Manual asset entry (up to 10 assets).
